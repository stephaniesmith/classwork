# Class 13 Express Middleware

## Questions and Issues?

* ?

## Today's Learning Objectives

* Correctly order app routes and multi-function routes by knowing how middleware "flows"
* Understand what third-party middlewares like `express.json` are actually doing and consume third-party middleware via npm modules like `morgan`
* Modularize resource routes using `express.Router()`
* Create middleware chains using `app.use` and `app.METHOD`
* Create custom, tested middleware using express middleware functions
* Correctly handle middleware errors and 404 errors by setting up express error handling middleware functions 
* Use the `next()` function to selectively apply common app logic like authentication and authorization
* Introduce custom properties on the request object

## Agenda

### Express Middleware

#### Middle-what?

* Ambiguous based on broad history
* Larger architectural meaning - middle between API and db
* For our purposes, think about the middle between request and response
* Basic "handler": `( req, res[, next] ) => { ... }`
* Middleware is flow to find one or more handlers

#### All starts with `app.use()`

* `app.METHOD` "short cuts"
* `next()` - let another router handle response
    * `( res, req[, next] ) => { ... }`
* order matters

**Exercise #1**: Add a few `app.use()`

#### Calling `next()`

Revisit `express.static()`:    
* What does it do if `ENOENT`?

**DEMO**: `morgan`
**EXERCISE #2**: Add morgan to see output

#### Tested Middleware

**DEMO**: TDD ~~Authentication~~ Cathentication middleware

**EXERCISE #3**: TDD your own logger!

#### Functional middlewares

* Okay for middleware not to handle response, just do additional work
* Sometimes this is what people mean by middleware
* body-parser, authentication, authorization

#### Another axis

* `app.use( fn1, fn2, fn3 )`
* `next('route')`

#### Another branch...

* on to [`express.Router`](https://github.com/martypdx/workshop-express-middleware/blob/master/router.md)...

### [Express middleware and `next()`](https://github.com/martypdx/workshop-express-middleware/blob/master/next.md)

#### Middleware error handling

##### Types of errors

* Expected
    * Mongoose Validation errors
    * 404 (not found)
    * 400 bad request
    * 401 not authentication
* Unexpected (500)

##### Sources

* Explicitly thrown
* Unhandled Promise rejections

## Modularized express project

* `lib`
    * `models`
    * `routes`
    * `app.js`
    * [util folders]
    * [other top-level important .js]
